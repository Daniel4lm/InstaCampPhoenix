# Instacamp Phoenix App

This app, partially inspired by [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) is a small app platform as part of my personal challenge to help me improve my coding knowledge.

InstaCamp is made with the PETAL(Phoenix, Elixir, TailwindCSS, AlpineJS, LiveView) stack, without using AlpineJS.

### Continued development

### TO-DO list

Implement next features:

- Finish welcome/home page
- Complete page for searching posts by topic/tag(or incorporate it with the home page due the similar logic)
- User can make comment on other comment(maybe something like @mention)
- Modal window for warning messages before deleting
- Complete coverage of specifications and types for modules and functions (@spec and @type)
- Cover more code with Wallaby tests for all liveview and javascript aspects that cannot be properly tested with liveview testing
- Upgrade app to Phoenix 1.7(or newer) version


### Useful resources

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
